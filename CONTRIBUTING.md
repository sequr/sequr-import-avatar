# First off

Thank you for considering contributing to this project ðŸ˜€. All our project have one goal: to be simple to understand by anybody For example:

- The way we write our comments is on purpose, because we found that this way is the easiest way for a brain to focus and understand
- In JavaScript code we just use `let` instead of `const` since the use case of `const` is very narrow. And usign it just becasue would casue unnecesary confusion

# What we believe in

- Making everything as simple as possible

# Childish Code

A way to say that code should be understood even by a child. Write simple to understand code. Don't make it obscure, to be the only one that can understand it. Be mindful of other people, and their time.
